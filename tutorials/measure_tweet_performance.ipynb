    "# Measure Tweet Performance\n",
    "\n",

    "- These metrics - such as the number of retweets, likes, replies, etc - can help you measure the performance of tweets.\n",
    "- Knowledge about these metrics can be used to enhance engagement and understand more about your audience preferences. - This is based on the repository [TweetsWithBearerToken](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code/blob/main/Tweet-Lookup/get_tweets_with_bearer_token.py)\n",
    "- We will be using tweeets lookup API to get metrics pertaining to a tweet, more details can be found here [TweetsLookUp](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/lookup/api-reference/get-tweets) "
